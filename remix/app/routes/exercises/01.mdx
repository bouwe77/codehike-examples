# Exercise 1 - Your first React components

In this exercise we will update and create components for your _Spaceship_ React app. üöÄ

## The component tree of our app

At this moment the app consists of the following component tree structure:

- App
  - Spaceship
  - Footer

In the following exercise we'll add the `Cockpit` component under the `Spaceship` component.

## Creating and rendering the Cockpit component

The first component we need is the `Cockpit` component. However, it does not exist yet, so let's create it:

> üí° Don't fully understand the exercise? Ask for help and/or refer to the [example code](/example-code) for some inspiration.

1. Open the `Spaceship` component in the file `src/components/Spaceship.js`.

2. Import the `CockpitImage` component from the `src/graphics` folder:

```js
import CockpitImage from "../graphics/CockpitImage"
```

3. Remove the comment and render the `CockpitImage` component: `<CockpitImage />`.

4. Now save everything and verify in the browser you see the cockpit image. üéâ

5. In the `src/components` folder, create a file called `Cockpit.js`.

6. Create a function called `Cockpit` and `export default` it.

7. Return the following JSX: an empty, self closing `div` with a `className="cockpit"`.

8. In the `Spaceship` component, import the `Cockpit` component you just created:

```js
import Cockpit from "./Cockpit"
```

9. After the `<CockpitImage />`, render the `Cockpit` component: `<Cockpit />`.

Notice we have a problem now: You are rendering (and returning) JSX with two components,
but JSX requires us to always wrap all JSX in a single parent element. So let's do that now:

10. Add a `div` element around the components:

```js
<div>
  <CockpitImage />
  <Cockpit />
</div>
```

9. Verify you still only see the image of the cockpit, because the Cockpit component is still empty.

10. However, if you open up developer tools, and click on the elements tab, you will see that the
    `Cockpit` component div is also rendered.

11. Notice how we also see the wrapper `div` element from the `Spaceship` component. This `div`
    is not really necessary, so let's replace it by an empty element, also called a `Fragment`:

```js
<>
  <CockpitImage />
  <Cockpit />
</>
```

## Rendering the left side screen with the Map component

The cockpit is rather empty, so let's add a screen on the left side which will show a map of space.
It helps you to locate your ship, but also other spaceships, planets and space stations.

I already built a `Map` component, so all you have to do is _render_ it:

1. Open the `Cockpit` component.

2. Import the `Map` component from the `Map` folder: `import Map from './map'`.

3. Inside the cockpit `div`, add a new `div` with `className="screen sidescreen leftscreen"`.

4. You should see a monitor on the left side of the cockpit.

5. Inside the `div` you just created, render the `Map` component: `<Map />`

6. Verify you see a "Map" button. When you click it you'll see an enlarged left screen
   with an interactive space map. üöÄ ü™ê üõ∞ üòÉ

## Displaying JS variables in JSX

Soon we'll add controls to the cockpit so we are able set course and take off. But before we do this we'll
add two more screens that will display information about the status of the spaceship.

The _middle_ screen will display information about the so-called _engine mode_. The engine mode can either be "stand by",
meaning the engine does nothing, "thrusters" for taking off or "impulse" for flying long distances.

The _right_ screen will display more information about our location, but in this exercise we'll only add the screen itself.

I already created empty `MiddleScreen` and `RightScreen` components.

1. Open the `Cockpit` component.

2. Import both the `MiddleScreen` and `RightScreen` components.

3. In the JSX, just below the `middlescreen div`, render both components:

```jsx
<div className="cockpit">
  <div className="screen sidescreen leftscreen">
    <Map />
  </div>
  <MiddleScreen />
  <RightScreen />
</div>
```

4. Notice how two extra screens have appeared in the cockpit.

5. Open the `MiddleScreen` component.

6. Inside the function body, but **before** the `return` statement,
   create an `engineMode` variable with the value `"stand by"`:

```js
export default function MiddleScreen() {
  const engineMode = "stand by"

  return <div className="screen middlescreen"></div>
}
```

7. In the JSX, inside the `div`, render the `engineMode` variable between curly braces:

```jsx
<div className="screen middlescreen">
  <h1>engine mode:</h1> {engineMode}
</div>
```

> üí° Spot the `engineMode` variable. In order to render it, it is surrounded by _curly braces_.

8. Verify the `engineMode` is displayed correctly by manually changing the value in code.
